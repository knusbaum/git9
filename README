Git for Plan 9: git9/fs
======================

All commits in this repository were made with git9 running on 9front.

About
-----

Plan 9 is a non-posix system. Upstream git has been ported, but feels
distinctly un-plan9ish, and even in its native environment, has been
justifiably tarred and feathered for its user experience.

Git9/fs implements a git client for plan 9.  The intent is to support
working with git repositories, without cloning the git interface
directly.

Git9/fs is usable, but not battle tested. It works for me, and covers
the features I need on a daily basis.

Getting Started
---------------

Get a bootstrap copy:

	% cd /tmp
	% hget https://github.com/oridb/git9/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xvz
	% cd git9-master
	% mk all
	% mk install

Get an updatable version from git:

	% cd $home/src
	% git9/clone https://github.com/oridb/git9
	% cd git9
	% mk all
	% mk install

Configure your user name and email:

	% mkdir -p $home/lib/git
	% echo '
	[user]
		name=Ori Bernstein
		email=ori@eigenstate.org
	' > $home/lib/git9/config

And start committing!

Structure
---------

The git9/fs program provides a file system mounted on /mnt/git.  It
provides a read-only view into the repository contents to allow
scripts to inspect the data.  Surrounding scripts and binaries will
manipulate the repository contents directly.  These changes will be
immediately mirrored in the file system.

Scripts will generally mount git9/fs as needed to do
their work, but if you want to browse the repository
manually, run it yourself. You'll get `/mnt/git` mounted,
with the following contents:

	/mnt/git/object:	The objects in the repo.
	/mnt/git/branch:	The branches in the repo.
	/mnt/git/ctl:		A file showing the status of the repo.
				Currently, it only shows the current branch.
	/mnt/git/HEAD		An alias for the currently checked out
				commit directory.

Visible Differences
-------------------

The most obvious difference is that Git's index is a bit boneheaded, so I'm
ignoring it.  The index doesn't affect the wire protocol, so this
isn't an interoperability issue, unless you share the same physical
repository on both Plan 9 and Unix.  If you do, expect them to disagree
about the files that have been modified in the working copy.

In fact, the entire concept of the staging area has been dropped, as
it's both confusing and clunky.  There are now only three states that
files can be in: 'untracked', 'dirty', and 'committed'.  Tracking is
done with empty files under .git/index9/{removed,tracked}/path/to/file.

It's implemented in Plan 9 flavor C, and provides tools for writing
repository contents, and a file system for read-only access, which
will mirror the current state of the repository.

Installation
------------

Install with `mk install`.

Examples
--------

Some usage examples:

	git9/clone git://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mc.git
	git9/log
	cd subdir/name
	git9/add foo.c
	diff bar.c /mnt/git/HEAD/
	git9/commit foo.c
	git9/push

Commits are presented as directories with the following
contents:

	author:	A file containing the author name
	hash:	A file containing the commit hash
	parent:	A file containing the commit parents, one per line.
	msg:	A file containing the log message for that commit
	tree:	A directory containing a view of the repository.

So, for example:

	% ls /mnt/git/branch/heads/master
	/mnt/git/branch/heads/master/author
	/mnt/git/branch/heads/master/hash
	/mnt/git/branch/heads/master/msg
	/mnt/git/branch/heads/master/parent
	/mnt/git/branch/heads/master/tree
	% cat /mnt/git/branch/heads/master/hash
	7d539a7c08aba3f31b3913e0efef11c43ea9

	# This is the same commit, with the same contents.
	% ls /mnt/git/object/7d539a7c08aba3f31b3913e0efef11c43ea9f9ef
	/mnt/git/object/7d539a7c08aba3f31b3913e0efef11c43ea9f9ef/author
	/mnt/git/object/7d539a7c08aba3f31b3913e0efef11c43ea9f9ef/hash
	/mnt/git/object/7d539a7c08aba3f31b3913e0efef11c43ea9f9ef/msg
	/mnt/git/object/7d539a7c08aba3f31b3913e0efef11c43ea9f9ef/parent
	/mnt/git/object/7d539a7c08aba3f31b3913e0efef11c43ea9f9ef/tree

	# out the non-git files.

The following utilities and binaries are provided:

	fs:	The git filesystem.
	fetch:	The protocol bits for getting data from a git server.
	send:	The protocol bits for sending data to a git server.
	save:	The gnarly bits for storing the files for a commit.
	conf:	A program to extract information from a config file.
	clone:	Clones a repository.
	commit:	Commits a snapshot of the selected files.
	log:	Prints the contents of a commmit log.
	add:	Tells the repository to add a file to the next commit.
	walk:	`du`, but for git status.


Supported protocols: git:// and git+ssh://. If someone
implements others, I'll gladly accept patches.

9legacy Notes
-------------

To use git9 on 9legacy, these patches are necessary.

	- rc-line-split: implement delim{...} syntax for rc
	- walk: port walk command to 9legacy.

Additionally, git9 defaults to editing with hold(1). This command
is not present on 9legacy. Import it, or set $editor to your choice
of editor.
